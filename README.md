# PCA_LDA_from_scratch

## Problem statement

**Principal Component Analysis:**

Use all training images of three digits (‘4’, ‘7’ and ‘8’) in MNIST to estimate the principal component analysis (PCA) projection matrices, and then plot the total distortion error of these images as a function of the used PCA dimensions (such as 2, 10, 50, 100, 200, 300). Also, mention at least how many dimensions will you have to use in PCA in order to keep 98% of the total variance in data?

**Linear Discriminant Analysis:**

Use all training images of three digits (‘4’, ‘7’ and ‘8’) to estimate linear discriminant analysis (LDA) projection matrices for all possible LDA dimensions. What are the maximum LDA dimensions you can use in this case?

## Solution

**Principal Component Analysis:**

**Linear Discriminant Analysis:**
